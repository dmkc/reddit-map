**reddit-map** is a [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)-style map 
for [Reddit](http://reddit.com) that lets you quickly navigate around
 a thread of comments.

## To do
* collapsing comments changes the map accordingly
* upvoted comments light up green
* downvoted comments light up red
* possibly reimplement using `canvas` as an exercise
