`reddit-lens` is a [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) style map that
lets you quickly navigate a thread's comments.

## To do
* collapsing comments changes the map accordingly
* upvoted comments light up in green
* downvoted comments light up in red
* possibly reimplement using `canvas` as an exercise
